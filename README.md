# Project Euler

This repository contains a set of solutions to some problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve.

My current statistics on Project Euler are:

# Solutions and programming languages

Most solutions are derived in three different approaches (paradigms) using Java, Python and F# programming languages.

# Upcoming

## New programming languages

For learning purposes, solutions will be transcribed over time in the following programming languages (in order of priority).

* Haskell;
* R;
* Rust.

## Statistical analysis

- [ ] Automate tests; 
- [ ] Log execution time for each approach/programming language;
- [ ] Automate graph generation from gathered data.

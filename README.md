# Project-Euler

This repository contains a set of solutions to some problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve.

Most solutions are derived in three different approaches (paradigms) using Java, Python and F# programming languages.

# Project Euler

This repository contains a set of solutions to some problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve.

My current statistics on Project Euler are:

I solved these a long time ago using brute force the vast majority of the time. I'm now rewriting each one of these solutions in a much smarter, faster, economic way.

# Solutions and programming languages

Most solutions are derived in three different approaches (paradigms) using Java, Python and F# programming languages.

## Performances

All performances are automatically gathered and compared in a [beautiful graph](report/graph.pdf). Please note that the time scale is logarithmic and in microseconds.

# Upcoming

## New programming languages

For learning purposes, solutions will be transcribed over time in the following programming languages (in order of priority).

* C++;
* Haskell;
* R;
* Rust;
* good ol' PHP for fun.
